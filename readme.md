# Video Player

This repository contains a video player JavaScript code snippet that can be used to create a custom video player interface for web applications. The code provides functionalities such as play/pause, progress bar, volume controls, playback speed adjustment, and fullscreen mode. The code is written in JavaScript and can be integrated with existing HTML and CSS files.

## Prerequisites

To use the video player code, you need to have a basic understanding of JavaScript. You should also have an existing HTML file with the necessary structure and a CSS file to style the video player.

## Getting Started

To integrate the video player code into your project, follow these steps:

1. Copy the JavaScript code provided in the [script.js](script.js) file.

2. Open your existing HTML file in your preferred code editor.

3. Paste the JavaScript code into a new `<script>` tag or include it in an existing `<script>` tag in your HTML file.

4. Save your HTML file.

5. Open your HTML file in a web browser to see the video player in action.

## Functionalities

The video player provides the following functionalities:

- Play & Pause: Clicking on the play button starts or pauses the video playback. The play button icon updates accordingly.

- Progress Bar: The progress bar displays the current position of the video and allows users to seek to different parts of the video. The progress bar updates as the video plays, showing the elapsed time and the total duration of the video.

- Volume Controls: Users can adjust the volume of the video by clicking on the volume bar. The volume icon changes dynamically based on the volume level.

- Mute/Unmute: Clicking on the volume icon toggles between mute and unmute. When muted, the volume bar and icon indicate the mute status.

- Change Playback Speed: Users can adjust the playback speed of the video using the playback speed control. Changing the value of the playback speed control updates the video's playback rate.

- Fullscreen Mode: The video player includes a fullscreen button that allows users to view the video in fullscreen mode. Clicking on the fullscreen button toggles between fullscreen and normal mode.

## Customization

You can customize the video player by modifying the JavaScript code to add additional functionalities or modify the existing ones. You can also adjust the HTML structure and CSS styles to fit your project's requirements. The provided JavaScript code serves as a starting point, and you can extend it to meet your specific needs.
